Homework - Data Structures and Complexity
Due: 03-13-2020 (Friday @ 3:30 p.m.)
Given a collection of algorithms that runs on O(1), O(n log n), O(n), O(n2), O(log n), O(n!), order the algorithms from fastest to slowest.

Suppose that the complexity of an algorithm is O(n2). Suppose that the program that uses the algorithm run in 10 seconds for a data set of size n. If the data size is doubled, how long will it take (approximately) to run the program?

Complexities : O(1), O(n log n), O(n), O(n2), O(log n), O(n!) , O(h) 1.Finding the max element in an unordered stack would require _____________ operations?

Finding the min element in an unordered queue would require _____________ operations?

Finding some element in some Binary Search Tree would require _____________ operations?

Finding some element in a balanced Binary Search Tree would require _____________ operations?

Finding some element in an ordered linked list would require _____________ operations (worst case)?

Finding some element in an ordered linked list would require _____________ operations (average case)?

Finding some element in an unordered linked list would require _____________ operations (worst case)?

For each of the following, count the number of operations where some_statement is executed based on the loops

//A
for (int I = 0; I < n; I++)
    for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)
        {some_statement;}
//B
for (int I = 0; I < n; I +=2)
    for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)
        {some_statement;}
//C
for (int j = 1 ; j < n ; j *= 2)
    for (int I = 1; i<n; i++)
        {some_statement;} 
At most, how many comparisons are required to search a sorted vector of 1023 elements using the binary search algorithm?

In each of the following examples, please choose the best data structure(s).

Options are: Array, Linked Lists, Stack, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Sets, Hash Tables.

You need to store undo/redo operations in a word processor.
You need to evaluate an expression (i.e., parse).
You need to store the friendship information on a social networking site. I.e., who is friends with who.
